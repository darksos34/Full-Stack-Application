Writing more and more.

I have been adjusting my thinking how to build a full stack application.

By just doing and making mistakes over and over again.

How do I start my projects?

Start by getting free components and start building a fresh application.<br>
After building a project try to destructure your components.<br>
Just change your code, but do not forgot to keep your code clean.<br>
Do not make a spaghetti-code.  

Keep on moving forward, every moment you learn a new skill, that means you are making progress.

Of course, you need to keep on repeating and testing your own code if it is what you expected. 


Support Readme will be added for more info and a guideline.
